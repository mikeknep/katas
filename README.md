# Code Katas

This is a collection of coding katas. Currently only Ruby, but I expect more will come soon.


## Ruby
#### Coin Changer
Takes an integer input 0-99 and returns an equivalent array of US coins

#### Fizzbuzz
Takes an integer input and returns a string of all the numbers up to and including that number.

Any number divisible by 3 is replaced with "fizz".

Any number divisible by 5 is replaced with "buzz".

If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it is replaced with "fizzbuzz".

#### Number Converter
Can convert arabic integers to roman numberals, or vice versa.

#### Prime Factors
Takes an integer input and returns an array of its prime factors.

(Any positive integer is either prime or a product of primes.)
